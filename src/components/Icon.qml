    \qmltype Icon
    \inqmlmodule PSS.Components 1.0
    \brief Displays an icon from the icon theme or another (local or remote) location.

    An icon from the icon theme can be specified with the \c iconName property
    otherwise an icon from a local or remote source can be specified with the
    \c iconSource property.  Icons can also be colorized, set the \c color
    property to change all pixels with the \c originalColor color.

    Icon themes are a set of icons referred to by a standard name defined in the
    \l{http://standards.freedesktop.org/icon-naming-spec/icon-naming-spec-latest.html}{Freedesktop Icon Naming Specification}
    to improve consistency between applications.

    Icon themes also respect the
    \l{http://standards.freedesktop.org/icon-theme-spec/icon-theme-spec-latest.html}{Freedesktop Icon Theme Specification}.

    Example of icon from the icon theme:
    \code
    Icon {
        iconName: "gimp"
        width: 64
        height: 64
    }
    \endcode

    Example of icon from a local source:
    \code
    Icon {
        iconSource: "edit-cut.png"
        width: 16
        height: 16
    }
    \endcode

    Example of colorization:
    \code
    Icon {
        iconName: "edit-cut-symbolic"
        width: 16
        height: 16
        color: "green"
    }
    \endcode

        When \c color will be set, this component will render the icon
        by replacing all pixels of \c originalColor color to \c color.

        This is set to \l #bebebe by default but can be changed
        to match the original color of the icon.

        Colors that were originally of \c originalColor color will be
        changed to this color.

        Symbolic icons are simplified icons that usually are monochrome.
        Don't set this property for non-symbolic icons unless you know
        what you are doing.

          \li Image.Ready - the image has been loaded

    property alias status: image.status

    /*!
        Specifies whether the image should be cached.
        The default value is true.

        Setting cache to false is useful when dealing with large images,
        to make sure that they aren't cached at the expense of small
        'ui element' images.
